... wait a specified amount of time before checking surroundings ... 

for each position:
	for each sensor:
		clear the trigger pin
		send the pulse
		time the reply
		compute the distance based on the reply time
		if the distance is 0 or distance > MAX_DIST:
			print “out of range (on this face)!”
			// (Keep checking other faces)
		else:
			print distance
			set status to taken
			if status != taken (aka status has just changed):
				set status to taken
				[ send updated status to server ]
				// (don’t need to check other faces,
				//	since found an object already)
			return	// restarts Arduino loop

// (If reached here, did not leave loop above early)
if status != not taken (aka status has just changed):
	set status to not taken
	[ send updated status to server ]
